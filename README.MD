### 1. Acquiring Dataset and Preprocessing

Use the [DoReMi Dataset](https://github.com/steinbergmedia/DoReMi). Apply image enhancement techniques (i.e. noise reduction, contrast adjustment, binarization).

Detect and important entities (e.g., staff lines, individual musical symbols).

### 2. Optical Music Recognition (OMR)

Using CNN to detect and classify individual musical symbols (notes, clefs, rests, dynamics, etc.). 

Remove staff lines to prevent interference with symbol recognition. 

Classify symbols based on its shape and relative position on the staff.
